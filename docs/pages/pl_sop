Uberlab.llb is the labview library that contains all the scripts (labview .vi files) that are used to create PL maps.

This library primary job is to interface with a National Instruments Data Aquisition board (NI DAQ). The DAQ controls the position of a piezo stage or a angle of scanning mirror using a DC output, and receives a signal from APDs in the form of a stream of pulses which is recoreded as a countrate.
