Radiative Lifetime
-------------------
- **Definition:** Lifetime of an electronic state in the (hypothetical) situation where only radiative processes depopulate that level

The radiative lifetime of an electronic state refers to the lifetime which would be obtained through radiative decay only via "spontaneous emission". It is given by the equation

.. math:: 
    \frac{1}{\tau_{rad}} = \frac{8\pi n^2}{c^2} \int v^2 \sigma_{em}(v) \, dv = 8\pi n^2 c \int \frac{\sigma_{em} (\lambda)}{\lambda^4} \, d\lambda
