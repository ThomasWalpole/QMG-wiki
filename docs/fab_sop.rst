Fabrication Methods
===================

Photolithography
----------------

For big wafers use big containers.

Stuff you need:
- DI water (MilliQ)
- Hot plate (100 :math:`^\circ`C)

Cupboard:
- Developer AZ 726
- Photo resist AZ 1518

Fume Cupboard:
- Spin coater

Steps:

1. To clean substrate: use IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol), either wipe with Kimtech or use spin coater and spray IPA.

2. Select Program on spin coater with rpm ~4000 in vacuum:
   :math:`\rightarrow` Start
     - Squirt acetone and then IPA through lid hole.
     - Check surface, if not clean then wipe with Kimtech and then spin again with IPA ~ 1 min.

3. Drop resist all over and spread gently using the dropper (do not waste as we are poor):
   :math:`\rightarrow` Start

4. Place substrate on hot plate for 1 min to *bake*.

5. Place substrate on *marked mask* mask, coated side face down.

6. Plug vacuum line in, once aligned: 

7. Turn on *illumination* dial.

- Pull side rod out for monitor view.
- Check your pattern is aligned with microscope.

8. Put substrate in, turn down “illumination” to prevent exposure to resist.

9. WEC setting:

- Close contact lever.
- Follow instructions.

10. Parameters:
- Exposure time ~2 sec
    :math:`\rightarrow` Load
- Exposure (TURN AWAY)

11. Open lever, take substrate out.

12. Develop for 10 seconds (INSERT DIAGRAM) then immediately into water.

13. Dry surface with N2, bottom side with Kimtech.

14. Check with microscope.

Oxygen plasma cleaning
----------------------

1. Manual process. Make sure the bottom two buttons are not green.

2. Vent vacuum
   :math:`\rightarrow` Open Lid :math:`\rightarrow` Load sample :math:`\rightarrow` Close lid

3. Select recipe:

.. list-table:: Title
   :widths: 25 25

   * - Pres. Set (mT), 10
     - 10
   * - ICP set
     - 5
   * - RIE set
     - 25
   * - Process time
     - 10

4. Turn gas on
   :math:`\rightarrow` When gas is ready, turn RF on for 10 seconds.
